/*How Does updated_cubature branch differes from the current master branch?

/*In the current master(default) branch, dcuhre is used for vector integration. In this branch, the class CIntegrateCubature in Integrator.h helps carry integration of both vector and scalar integrands. A common code package, Steven G.Johnson's cubature-1.10.3, is used for this purpose. This code is a free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (v2 or later) and available for download at stevengj/cubature. Thus the file integratevec.h though present, is not needed.*/
